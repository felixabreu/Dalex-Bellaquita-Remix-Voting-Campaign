The Dalex Bellaquita Challenge was a campaign we conducted to get our fans to engage with the release by posing as the cover art of the Bellaquita Remix song. The campaign garnered the engagement of over 500 participants, catapulting the song to over which now holds over 200 Million views on Youtube. 

In this campaign I wanted to continue working with getting comfortable with CSS3 animations, making the loading screen an astronaut flying super speed through space, playing on the "Dalexcito" alien branding Dalex has. 

This campaign was also different in that we decided to test how willing our fans were in participating in the voting. We had some users receive the request to submit their email in order to vote, and for some we didnt list the option. THe goal was to confirm that regardless of whether we require fans to submit information, they would still submit it as long as it was a part of the user experience. 

We managed that by selecting a number randomly between 1 and 2 during the loading of the page (when Dalexcito flies super speed through the galaxies!).
